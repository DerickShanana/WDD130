      <p>Hello! My name is Derick Shanana and I am from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. I enjoy watching Anime,  listening to music and sudying the scriptures. My favourite scripture is Ether 12:6- And now I Moroni would speak somewhat concerning these things, I would show unto the world that faith is the things which are hoped for and no seen, whereefore dispute not because ye see not. For you receive no witness until after the trial of your faith</p>
