    <p>Hello! My name is Derick Shanana and I am from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. I enjoy watching Anime, listening to music, and studying the scriptures. My favorite scripture is Ether 12:6 - "And now, I Moroni would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith."</p>
